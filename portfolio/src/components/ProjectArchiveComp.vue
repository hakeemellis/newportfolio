    <p>
      I’m a junior software engineer with hands-on experience across various
      tech stacks, driven by a curiosity for solving complex problems and
      building seamless digital experiences. My journey began with a fascination
      for how code transforms ideas into interactive solutions, and today, I’m
      excited to apply that passion in real-world projects.
      <br />
      <br />
      I’ve worked with languages and frameworks such as JavaScript, React,
      Python, and Node.js, creating everything from dynamic front-end interfaces
      to robust back-end services. My experience includes personal projects,
      freelance work, and collaborative coding challenges that have strengthened
      my skills in responsive design, API integration, and building
      user-friendly web applications.
      <br />
      <br />
      I’m particularly interested in accessibility and usability, ensuring that
      the software I create is inclusive and optimized for all users. Whether
      it’s debugging tricky issues or learning new technologies, I approach
      challenges with persistence and adaptability.
